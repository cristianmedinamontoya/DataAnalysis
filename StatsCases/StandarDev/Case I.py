#While the mean and median can tell us about the center of our data, they do not reflect the range of the data. Thatâ€™s where standard deviation comes in.

#Similar to the interquartile range, the standard deviation tells us the spread of the data. The larger the standard deviation, 
# the more spread out our data is from the center. The smaller the standard deviation, the more the data is clustered around the mean.
