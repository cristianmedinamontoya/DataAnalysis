#In script.py, weâ€™ve provided data about a trial for a new allergy medication, AllerGeeThatSucks!
#Five participants were asked to rate how drowsy the medication made them once a day for three 
#days on a scale of one (least drowsy) to ten (most drowsy).
#Use np.mean to find the average level of drowsiness across 
#all the trials and save the result to the variable total_mean.

#Use np.mean to find the average level of drowsiness across each day of the experiment and save to the variable trial_mean.
#Use np.mean to find the average level of drowsiness across for each individual patient to see if some were more sensitive
#to the drug than others and save it to the variable patient_mean.
#Print the variables for total_mean, trial_mean, and patient_mean on three separate lines.
