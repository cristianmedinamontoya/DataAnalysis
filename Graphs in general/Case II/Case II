#Our friend discovered a femur from an unidentified dinosaur on his last dig.
#The femur is 6.6 feet long.
#Your friend is pretty sure that the femur belongs to either a brachiosaurus 
# or a fictionosaurus. Looking at the graphed data, determine which dinosaur 
# this skeleton is most likely to belong, and save your answer to the variable mystery_dino.

mystery_dino = 'Brachiosaurus'

#Our friend discovered another femur. This femur is 7.5 ft long. Obviously,
#  7.5 ft is closer to the mean for a fictionosaurus (7.7 ft), than it is to the mean
# for a brachiosaurus (6.5 ft).
#Can we be absolutely sure that the femur came from a fictionosaurus? Save you answer 
# (either True or False) to answer.

answer = False

#The answer is logic bc we cannot be 100% sure that the discovered femur is from either branchio or Fictio
